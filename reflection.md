What Copilot generated

Copilot provided useful scaffolding and several small helper functions that formed the core of the initial cleaning pipeline. In particular, suggestions for `load_data`, `clean_column_names`, `handle_missing_values`, and `remove_invalid_rows` were inserted as Copilot-assisted stubs/comments in the code. I triggered these suggestions by adding brief descriptive comments and partial function signatures (for example, `# Copilot-assisted function: load_data`), then accepted and inspected the returned code fragments. These suggestions saved time and gave a clean starting point for implementing the full pipeline.

What I modified

I made several structural and behavioral changes to the Copilot suggestions so the script would be more robust and better fit the repository's needs. I renamed and consolidated column-name logic (the `standardize_column_names` function) and refactored the pipeline so helper functions are single-purpose and composable. I added new functions that were not provided by Copilot: `remove_empty_rows`, `deduplicate_rows`, `normalize_categories`, and `finalize_types_and_compute_totals`. I also removed a duplicated run-block Copilot had left at the end of the file and replaced it with a single `main()` entry point. For missing-value handling I kept the median-fill for `price` and zero-fill for `quantity`, but made the code more defensive (coerce to numeric, handle inf/NaN, fill with 0 if the median cannot be computed). These changes improve readability, correctness, and make the cleaning decisions explicit.

What I learned

Working on the cleaning script reinforced a few practical data-cleaning lessons and taught me how best to use Copilot as a development assistant. From a pandas perspective: always normalize headers early, coerce suspicious columns to numeric with `pd.to_numeric(..., errors='coerce')`, choose robust fills (median vs mean) for skewed numeric data, explicitly drop or flag negative values when they clearly indicate errors, and finalize dtypes before computing derived columns (e.g., `total_sales`). From a tooling perspective, Copilot is most helpful for repetitive boilerplate and for proposing idiomatic pandas patterns, but it is not a substitute for domain-aware decisions. A concrete example: Copilot suggested helper functions and a bottom-of-file example runner; I accepted the helpers but removed the duplicated runner and extended the helpers to handle edge cases (e.g., casting, NaNs, duplicates). In short, Copilot speeds up scaffolding, but the human developer must verify assumptions and adapt logic to real data.
